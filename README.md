# xVM
[![Build](https://github.com/noOne128/xVM/actions/workflows/c-cpp.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/noOne128/xVM/actions/workflows/c-cpp.yml)

Simple virtual machine

## Usage
Run ```make``` to just build xVM.

Run ```make run``` if you want to build xVM if its not built and run it.

**Running with just** ```bin/xvm``` **won't work** (commit [```3268c7f3```](https://github.com/no0ne228/xVM/commit/3268c7f3))
